        <p>
            I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department.
            Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer
            at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places
            for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve
            communication and coordination within small project teams. I
            was fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams product
            throughout an entire software lifecycle -- from initial product
            conception through the actual product launch.

            I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where
            specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on process
            support for software engineering terms. I also have a masters
            degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial
            Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and
            Electrical Engineering.
