            Mom, you're a wonderful mother,</BR>
            So gentle, yet so strong.</BR>
            The many ways you show you care</BR>
            Always make me feel I belong.</BR>
        </BR>
            You're patient when I'm foolish;</BR>
            You give guidance when I ask;</BR>
            It seems you can do most anything;</BR>
            You're the master of every task.</BR>
        </BR>
            You're a dependable source of comfort;</BR>
            You're my cushion when I fall.</BR>
            You help in times of trouble;</BR>
            You support me whenever I call.</BR>
        </BR>
            I love you more than you know;</BR>
            You have my total respect.</BR>
            If I had my choice of mothers,</BR>
            You'd be the one I'd select!</BR>
